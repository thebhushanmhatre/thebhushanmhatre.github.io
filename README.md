On Branch Automate

Using Python(or any another Programming Language), Trying to create a same website.
So we don't have to edit the HTML again and again.

Just add the Data and HTML will be generated on it own.

Have already done something similar using React(javascript) in another repo: [React-Portfolio](https://github.com/thebhushanmhatre/bhushan-portfolio).
But I have created that from scratch.
Now I would like to update current project.
Just for fun and learning something new.

Idea is to run ```python automate.py``` on local machine and everything will be genearted in "index.html.

Moved index.html to main.html as Backup
